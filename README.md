# ANN for prediction of moisture ratio 
Hello world!
This is a repository which consists of a nerual network that has been trained on experimental drying data of bitter gourd. The data  has been used then to predict the moisture ration of the substance at any instance of time.
I am completely open to suggestions on my code. The projects in this reopsitory are only works adapted by various sources.
I will give my best in making these project files as better as possible and find new ways to meddle with them.
And once I am at full force moving ahead I will have my own code with novel and native Ideas in a separate repository. 
Thank you for coming to my space and having a look!
